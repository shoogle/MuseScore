    DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE IN A GRAPHICAL SVG EDITING PROGRAM!
    The paths in this file use arcs, not Bezier curves, but SVG editors tend
    to convert everything to Bezier curves. This is fine in generated files
    but not in source files as it make shapes more difficult to understand.

    The logo is stored as a stroked path rather than a filled path as this
    allows the thickness of the letters to be changed easily. If you *need*
    a filled path (e.g. to add an outline) then use Inkscape to convert the
    stroke to a path as part of the build process.

      Base of U deliberately dips slightly below the M (overshoot).
      See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overshoot_(typography).
      The square linecap allows the letter stems to grow with the stroke,
      meaning the overshoot is preserved when the stroke-width is changed.

      The 'hat' is a semicircle and we don't want the ends to grow with the
      stroke-width or stick out past the dot, so we use the butt linecap.

      The diameter of the dot is slighly wider than the stroke-width of the
      other paths so that they appear the same width visually. The dot's
      radius must be manually adjusted whenever the stroke-width of the
      other paths is changed. NOTE: I tried implementing the dot as a small
      ring that would inherit the same stroke width as the other paths, but
      rendering was inconsistent between viewers.
