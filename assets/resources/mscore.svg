  <!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE IN A GRAPHICAL SVG EDITING PROGRAM! The paths in
  this file use arcs, not Bezier curves, but SVG editors have a bad habit of
  converting everything to Bezier curves. This is fine in generated files but
  it makes things more difficult to understand if it happens in source files.

  The logo is stored as a stroked path rather than a filled path as this
  allows the width to be changed easily. If you *need* a filled path (e.g. to
  add an outline) then use Inkscape to convert the stroke to a path as part
  of the build process. Do NOT do this to the original file. -->

      <!-- The dot looks like a filled circle but is actually a much smaller
      ring that has no fill but a very thick stroke. We draw a ring rather
      than a circle so it can inherit the same stroke properties as the other
      paths. The radius of the ring is small but non-zero so the dot is
      actually a little bit wider than the strokes of the letters and fermata.
      This is necessary to make them appear the same width visually. The round
      linecap and non-closed path are necessary to avoid renderer bugs. -->
